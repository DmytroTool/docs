# Device

A device can be MCU-based hardware like NodeMCU, a finished physical product like a Smart Air Conditioner,  or a virtual service that sends data to Blynk.Cloud server using REST API.

Every device on the Blynk platform has an AuthToken, a unique identifier generated by a Blynk.Cloud. There are few ways of obtaining AuthTokens depending on the project you are working on. You can read more about it [here](../getting-started/activating-devices/#2-activating-device-with-static-auth-token).

Every device inherits a [Device Template](device-template.md).
