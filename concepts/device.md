# Device

A device can be an MCU-based hardware \(e.g. NodeMCU, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc\), a finished physical product like a Smart Air Conditioner,  or a virtual service that sends data to Blynk.Cloud using REST API.

### AuthToken

Every device on the Blynk platform has an AuthToken – a unique identifier generated by Blynk.Cloud. There are few ways of obtaining AuthTokens depending on the project you are working on. You can read more about it [here](../getting-started/activating-devices/#2-activating-device-with-static-auth-token).

### Template Inheritance

Every device inherits a [Device Template](device-template.md). Make sure you understand this concept before you start building something on Blynk platform. 

### Ownership

A Device always belongs to an Organization and usually has an owner. In most common cases, it's a user who activated the device. However,  ownership can be changed by transferring the device to a different user and Organization

### Access

Access to a particular device can be limited based on user role and a set of permissions
