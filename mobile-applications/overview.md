# Overview

## Main screen 

The main app screen consists of up to 3 tabs depending on the configuration:  


**Devices**  
This section is open by default when you open the app. When there are no devices yet, there's a button "Add new device".  
All created devices will be listed here.

**Automation**  
You can automate your connected devices with the following triggers:  
  
- Time of the day  
- Sunset and sunrise  
- Device trigger  
- Manual execution \(Scenes\)  
  
****This section is visible only when the template has at least one datastream configured for automation. To enable the datastream for automation, please read the [Datastreams](../web-dashboard/for-developers/products/datastreams/datastreams-common-settings/) article.

**Alerts**  
The list of important alerts from all devices will be here. In order to be listed here, the template should have the [Event](../web-dashboard/for-developers/products/events/) configured and the event should be [triggered](../web-dashboard/for-developers/products/events/how-to-trigger-events.md) in the device.
