* **Admin** – supposed to have maximum permissions set
* **Staff** – we recommend to set up and use this role for user support processes such as handling user invitation, device check and debug, view and assist users' organizations
* **Users** – supposed to have least permissions set that is focued mostly on managing user's own devices.
