# Glossary

## 0..9

`Blynk.360` - a complex of `Blynk` services. Our web portal is the main entry point to Blynk.360.

## A

`Auth Token` - a unique identifier that is assigned to each device that is activated in the system.

`Automation` - condition-to-action sets allowing electronic `Devices` to complete various tasks with the minimal amount of human interaction.

## B

`Blynk.Air` - subsystem for management of over-the-air updates.

`Blynk.Inject` - implementation of `provisioning` for WiFi devices. See `Provisioning`.

`Blynk.Edgent` - Blynk `Firmware` implementation.

`Blynk Library` - Blynk `Library` implementation for integration with `Blynk.360`

`Blynk.Marketplace` - a registry of `Products`, that are available globally to all `Blynk` users.

`BlynkR` - subsystem for user registration and management

`Board` - microcontroller hardware that is used as a core of `Device`. List of supported hardware.

## C

`Category` - 

`Claiming` - process of associating the device with it's digital twin. I.e. when working with cellular devices, `Provisioning` is usually not required, so we use `claiming` to register each device in the system.

## D

`Dashboard` - a collection of `Widgets`.

`Device` - physical or virtual appliance, users can get telemetry from, configure, interact with, etc. Each device needs to be registered in the system.

`Datastream` - is a set of digital signals used for different kinds of content transmission.

`Dynamic Auth Token` -

## E

`Event` - an item in the device `Timeline` . On Apps, events are also displayed in the `Alerts` tab.

## F

`Firmware` - `Device` software that allows data exchange and commands execution inside the `Device` and between it and `Blynk.360`

## G

## H

`HTTP API` - a service that allows inter-operating with devices using a simple HTTP client. Devices can report their data using `HTTP` protocol.

## I

## J

## K

## L

`Library` - is a bunch of files embedded to the arduino (or any other) integrated development environment (IDE) that add more functionality and ease to the use the `Board`.

## M

`Metadata` - Metadata is a set of characteristics \(or configurations\) applied to every Product and associated with every Device

## N

`Notification` - a message sent by Email, SMS or Push after an `Event` occured

## O

`Offline Ignore Period` -

`Organization` -

`OTA` - over-the-air `Firmware` updates without accessing the `Device` physically.

## P

`Pin` - GPIO (General-purpose input/output) pin on your `Board` used to interface hardware (Servo, LCD and others) of your `Device`

`Product` - a `Template`, that is successfully published to `Blynk.Marketplace`

`Provisioning` -

`Profiling` -

## Q

## R

`Rule Engine` -

## S

`Shipment` - 

`Static Auth Token` -

## T

`Tag` -

`Template` - a set of elements and configurations, used to display all `Devices` of a particular type. `Templates` are created by `Developers`, and can be published to be accessible globally as `Products`.

`Template ID` - a unique identifier that is automatically assigned to each `Template`.

`Timeline` - 

`Transfer` -

## U

## V

`Virtual Pin -` think of them as channels for sending any data used to interface with other libraries and implement custom logic. Has have no physical representation.

## W

`Widget` - interface module that eases digital and analog data reading.

## Y

## Z
