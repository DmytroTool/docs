# System Events

There are **System Events** which can't be removed and **Custom Events** which you can create and configure as you need. 

## Online/Offline event

Online and Offline are system events handled by the server.

In some cases you would need to ignore offline state for a certain period of time. For example, if your device is mostly offline \(or in deep sleep\) and only wakes up every hour to send the data.

To set it up Go to Template -&gt; General - &gt; Offline Ignore Period.

## Over-the-air update event

When OTA happens, it's logged by the server automatically.
