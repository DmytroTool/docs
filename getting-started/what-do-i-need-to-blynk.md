# What do I need to Blynk?

To start building your first IoT projects you would need:

1. Create a Blynk account using Blynk.Console or [Blynk.App for iOS or Android](../downloads/blynk-apps-for-ios-and-android.md)
2. Supported hardware \(ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. List of supported devices is [here](../blynk.edgent/supported-boards.md).
3. Installed Blynk.Edgent \(a hardware library\)
4. Create a Blynk account using [Blynk.Console](https://blynk.cloud/) or [Blynk.App for iOS or Android](../downloads/blynk-apps-for-ios-and-android.md)
5. Supported hardware: ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. List of supported devices is [here](../blynk.edgent/supported-boards.md).
6. Installed Blynk.Edgent \(a hardware library\)

It's expected that you are familiar with basics of electric circuitry and know how to blink an LED using Arduino boards, know how to install libraries, etc.

If you have all of the above ready, you can jump directly to this article
