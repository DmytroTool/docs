# Developer Mode

**Developer** is a special user who has access to all the functionality required to configure the platform for use by end-users \(also called Clients\). This is usually someone who builds the hardware, develops the firmware, and does all the needed configurations.

By default, the ****first user in the Organization becomes a Developer.

Developer can: 

* Create and configure Device Templates in Blynk.360
* Create and configure web dashboard UI
* Create and configure a mobile dashboard UI
* Add new devices to the account
* Publish Templates to Blynk.Marketplace \(work in progress\)
* User other features accordingly to the chosen [plan](https://blynk.io/pricing%20)

### **Enable Developer Mode** 

1. In the Blynk app or in Blynk.360
2. Navigate to **My Profile**
3. Check that **Developer Mode** switch is set to ON

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, **only one developer is allowed per Organization** to avoid sync issues. This limit can be changed later.
{% endhint %}
