# Events

Events are used to track and log important events happening on your devices. Events can also trigger different types of notifications which can be sent over email, delivered as push notifications to user's smartphone, or sent as an SMS.

Examples of an Event: 

1. _You need to log a moment when a temperature reached a certain threshold and send a notification to selected users._
2. _You need to log a total working hours of the device. If it approaches or goes beyond a max value, you would need to notify technical support so that they can replace the device._
