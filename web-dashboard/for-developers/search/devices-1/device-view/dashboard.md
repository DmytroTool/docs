**Chart** – it's used to visualise live and historical data. You can use it for sensor data, for binary event logging and more. Chart display can be of 4 types: _Line, Area, Column, Stepline_

General chart properties:

* **Values axis** \(vertical\) – each Datastream added to Chart widget has it's scale on the right and left. It can be set manually or to be autoscaled during Template dashboard setup.
* **Timeline Axis** \(horizontal\) – helps to find values actual for the exact time the search is performed.
* **Hover the chart** – views value ant time for each selected point for each Datastream.
