# Getting Started: Connecting Arduino Devices

### Getting Started With Hardware <a id="getting-started-getting-started-with-hardware"></a>

#### Static Provision

Install the 1.0.0 beta3 library and use the ESP32 WiFi example.

In Blynk.360, add a template that's based on an ESP32 board, then create a device based on that template.  
The Template screen will give you two lines of firmware configuration, copy these and add them at the very beginning of your sketch.  
In the [Device &gt; Device Info ](../web-dashboard/for-developers/search/devices-1/device-view/device-info.md)screen you'll find the Auth Token \(left hand column, half way down\) click on the green square to the right to copy this to the clipboard...

and paste it into your sketch.

### How To Use an Example Sketch

You should by now have the Blynk 2 Library installed on your computer. If not - [click here](https://docs.blynk.cc/#downloads-blynk-library).  
Example sketches will help you get your hardware online quickly and major Blynk features.  
Open the example sketch according to the hardware model or shield you are using.

Letâ€™s take a look at the example sketch for an [Arduino UNO + Ethernet shield](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/GettingStarted/BlynkBlink/BlynkBlink.ino)

```text
#define BLYNK_PRINT Serial
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Ethernet.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEthernet.h>

char auth[] = "YourAuthToken";

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600); // See the connection status in Serial Monitor
  Blynk.begin(auth);  // Here your Arduino connects to the Blynk Cloud.
}

void loop()
{
  Blynk.run(); // All the Blynk Magic happens here...
}
```

#### Auth Token <a id="getting-started-getting-started-with-hardware-auth-token"></a>

In this example sketch, find this line:

```text
char auth[] = "YourAuthToken";
```

This is the [Auth Token](https://docs.blynk.cc/#getting-started-getting-started-with-application-4-auth-token) that you emailed yourself. Please check your email and copy it, then paste it inside the quotation marks.

It should look similar to this:

```text
char auth[] = "f45626c103a94983b469637978b0c78a";
```

Upload the sketch to the board and open Serial Terminal. Wait until you see something like this:

```text
Blynk v.X.X.X
Your IP is 192.168.0.11
Connecting...
Blynk connected!
```

**Congrats! You are all set! Now your hardware is connected to the Blynk Cloud!**
